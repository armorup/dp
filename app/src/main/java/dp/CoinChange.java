/**
 * Problem: Given an integer array coins representing different denominations
 * and an integer amount, return the minimum number of coins that make up the
 * amount. If that amount cannot be made up by any combination of the coins,
 * return -1.
 * Example
 * Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The minimum coins to make 11 are 5 + 5 + 1
 * 
 * Hint: You will want to set up a table where each index represents an amount,
 * starting from 0 up to the target amount. Some amounts are not achievable with
 * the coins provided.
